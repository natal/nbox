The FANN project is a C++ artificial neural network library.
The initial goal is to build a solid base for further algorithm optimisations.

Development has started on december 23rd 2011 by Benjamin Roux.
Compilation produces a dynamic library file (.so) at the root of the directory.
Headers are located in the src directory.
