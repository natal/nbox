. Find out why the learning process gets completly out of control
  -> The problem is related to the fact that the learning coefficient
     should adapt to how far the network is in the learning process.
  -> The program should distinguish between two main phases:
     * A broader phase where the coefficient should be large enough to
       speed up convergence towards the local minimum (in error).
     * A more narrow phase where the coefficient should be carefully
       chosen in order to find the local minimum in a small interval
  -> A solution involves learning from a cross problem and using the
     second derivative and Hessian matrices...
